    <p>
        This site was created with a singular mission: to facilitate connecting at-risk 
        members of the population, who must remain at home, with other residents in close 
        geographic proximity to them who are willing to purchase food or other essential
        supplies for them.

            No. This site is intended to connect people, not act as a payment

            each other.

            No. The website may ask for your current location or grab your IP address,
            but we do not store this information, nor do we expose it to others.
