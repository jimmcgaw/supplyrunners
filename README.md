# Shopping for Sheltered

This is a Django-based site that is intended to connect shelter-in-place residents who are at high risk and must remain at home with local residents who are willing to buy them food and other essential supplies during the COVID-19 quarantine.

While there are many organizations and charities that are designed to provide support in this regard, this site is intended to be peer-to-peer and directly connect people where these options are not available or have been overwhelmed due to demand.
